# Application Pitch

### A name
DueStack ðŸ“š

### A motivation
Deadlines are scattered across the academic stack-- DueStack compiles them into one reliable calendar so students can stay organized without the overhead.

### Key Features

DueStack offers three core features that together solve the problem of fragmented academic deadlines. Each feature integrates multiple underlying concepts but is designed to feel seamless for the user.

---

**Smart Canvas Sync**  
**What it is:**  
Automatically imports assignments, calendar events, and announcements from a studentâ€™s Canvas account after login.

**Why it helps:**  
Removes the need to manually input structured deadline data. Students get a pre-populated calendar with minimal effort, reducing errors and missed tasks.

**Who it helps:**  
- Students save time and avoid duplicating effort  
- Instructors receive fewer clarification questions  
- Platform admins increase utility of Canvas without additional work

---

**Syllabus & Image Parsers**  
**What it is:**  
Allows students to upload PDFs, or images. DueStack parses these sources using OCR and language models to extract potential deadlines for confirmation.

**Why it helps:**  
Captures unstructured deadlines that are buried in syllabi, static websites, or slide decks. What used to take hours of manual scanning now takes minutes.

**Who it helps:**  
- Students build complete deadline calendars faster  
- TAs reduce ambiguity without changing current workflows  
- Course staff maintain flexibility in how they share materials

**Interactive Deadline Dashboard**  
**What it is:**  
A centralized calendar and task tracker that displays all collected deadlines. Includes filters, status updates (e.g. "Not Started", "In Progress"), and calendar export options.

**Why it helps:**  
Transforms a passive list of deadlines into an actionable workspace. Students can plan, prioritize, and stay organized within a single view.

**Who it helps:**  
- Students manage their workload visually and efficiently  
- Peer collaborators can stay aligned through calendar sharing  
- Admins reduce friction across learning platforms

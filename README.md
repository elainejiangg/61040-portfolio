## About Me
*My name is Elaine Jiang, I'm a junior undergraduate studying 6-4 (Artificial Intelligence & Decision-Making), it's nice to meet you!*


Some fun facts about me:
1. I love cooking (+ Neapolitan pizza especially, ask me about my basil farm in my dorm).
2. I like to citi-bike in Central Park and feel the wind in my face like a dog.
3. I was in Arizona for the summer ☀️ (ask me how hot it was).
4. I like Calvin and Hobbes comics. their profoundness is unreal

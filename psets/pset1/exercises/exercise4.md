# Exercise 4: Defining familiar Concepts

*Deliverables: three concept specifications, with any subtleties explained in brief additional notes.*

1. URL Shortener

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">

**concept:** URLShortener  
**purpose:** create short, memorable URLs that redirect to longer destination URLs  
**principle:** a user provides a long URL and optionally a custom suffix; the system returns a short URL that maps to the original, and accessing the short URL redirects to the original

**states:**  
a set of Mappings with  
&nbsp;a shortCode String  
&nbsp;a longURL String  
&nbsp;a creator User  
&nbsp;a customFlag Boolean  

a counter AutoCodeCounter for generating unique random short codes  

**actions:**  

shorten(longURL: String, customCode: String?, user: User): (shortCode: String)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;customCode is either not provided or is not already in use  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if customCode is provided, create a mapping using it  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;otherwise, generate a random code using AutoCodeCounter and create a new mapping  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return the new shortCode  

redirect(shortCode: String): (longURL: String)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mapping exists for the given shortCode  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns the longURL associated with the shortCode  

delete(shortCode: String, user: User)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mapping exists for shortCode, and user is the creator  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removes the mapping  

**notes:**  
Short codes must be globally unique. The system may reject duplicate longURLs with the same customCode, but allows multiple short codes for the same longURL with different suffixes.

2. Conference Room Booking

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">

**concept:** RoomBookingSystem  
**purpose:** allow users to book and manage reservations for shared conference rooms without overlap or conflicts  
**principle:** each room maintains a schedule of non-overlapping reservations; a new booking can only be added if it does not conflict with any existing bookings

**states:**  
a set of Rooms with  
&nbsp;a roomID String  
&nbsp;a schedule List of Bookings  

a Booking with  
&nbsp;a roomID String  
&nbsp;a startTime DateTime  
&nbsp;a endTime DateTime  
&nbsp;a user User  

**actions:**  
book(roomID: String, start: DateTime, end: DateTime, user: User): (booking: Booking)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;room exists, no conflicting booking in the interval  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;adds booking to room‚Äôs schedule  

cancel(booking: Booking, user: User)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;booking exists and belongs to user  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;removes booking from schedule  

getAvailability(start: DateTime, end: DateTime): (availableRooms: Set<Room>)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;start < end  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns rooms that are free in the interval  

**notes:**  
Overlap detection must be atomic to prevent race conditions in concurrent booking scenarios. Bookings are assumed to be in the future (i.e., cannot book dates/times in the past).

3.  Electronic Boarding Pass

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">

**concept:** ElectronicBoardingPass  
**purpose:** provide passengers with an up-to-date, scannable digital credential for boarding a flight, reflecting real-time flight information  
**principle:** a boarding pass is tied to a passenger and flight, includes necessary metadata like seat and gate, and reflects live updates from backend flight data

**states:**  
a set of BoardingPasses with  
&nbsp;a passengerID String  
&nbsp;a flightID String  
&nbsp;a seat String  
&nbsp;a issuedAt DateTime  

a set of Flights with  
&nbsp;a flightID String  
&nbsp;a gate String  
&nbsp;a departureTime DateTime  
&nbsp;a status Enum {scheduled, delayed, boarding, departed, canceled}  

**actions:**  

issueBoardingPass(passengerID: String, flightID: String, seat: String): (pass: BoardingPass)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flight exists, status is scheduled or delayed  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creates a new boarding pass with given passenger and seat, tied to the specified flight with flightID

updateFlight(flightID: String, gate?: String, departureTime?: DateTime, status?: Status)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flight exists and proposed updates represent a valid status transition (e.g. not from departed to delayed), and departureTime is in the future if updated  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;updates the flight‚Äôs gate, time, and/or status; all linked boarding passes (passes with the same flightID) reflect these updates automatically  

scanPass(passengerID: String, flightID: String): (valid: Boolean)  

&nbsp;**requires**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a boarding pass exists for the passenger and flight; flight status is boarding  

&nbsp;**effects**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;returns True if the boarding pass is valid for entry (i.e. flight is boarding, not canceled or departed)  

**notes:**  
Live updates to flight info must be propagated to all issued boarding passes in real time. Status transitions must follow valid state progressions, such as scheduled ‚Üí delayed ‚Üí boarding ‚Üí departed. The system should prevent nonsensical backward transitions like departed ‚Üí scheduled.
